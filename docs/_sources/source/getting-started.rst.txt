About
=====


**NETS** is a vanilla Deep Learning framework, made using only **NumPy**.
This project was first introduced as an assignment I made at the `University of Oslo
<https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5400/>`_ and `Stanford University
<http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html>`_
.
However, this project was recreated to make it *object-oriented like*.
**NETS** was highly inspired from `PyTorch
<https://pytorch.org/>`_ and `TensorFlow
<https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_.

============
Dependencies
============

**NETS** was made in Python 3.7 and uses multiple machine learning libraries :

- Numpy
- Pickle
- Json
- Time
- Pandas (Optional)
- Scipy (Optional)
- Scikit-Learn (Optional)



===========
Instalation
===========

To use this package, clone the repository at https://github.com/arthurdjn/nets on your laptop and from the root folder,
run on the commandline :

``pip install .``

This will install the package in your python environment and download all the latest dependencies. You can know use and tweak the parameters of pynews' models.
